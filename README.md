# Calculating a moving average using Python

You are a given a list of numbers `J` and a single number `p`. Write a function to return the minimum and maximum averages of the sequences of `p` numbers in `J`.

## Example

```python
J = [4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12]

p = 3
```

The function will return a tuple of the following:

`(4, 11)` the mininum average is 4 and the maximum average is 11.
